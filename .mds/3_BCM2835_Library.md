# BCM2835 Library

Every Raspberry Pi model has a diffferent version of the [Broadcom chip](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/processors.html), 
BCM2XXX. The Raspberry Pi 4B specifically has the BCM2711 chip. However, the [BCM2835 library](https://www.airspayce.com/mikem/bcm2835/) 
is compatible with all of the different Broadcom chip versions.
